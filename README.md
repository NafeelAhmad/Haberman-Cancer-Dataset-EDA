# Haberman-Cancer-Dataset-EDA

**Dataset contains cases from study conducted on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. It is collected from the study of University of Chicago's Billings Hospital between year 1958 to 1970.**

# Key Insights:

**Age:**
1) Most patients are aged under 50-55. i.e. around 18.3% of the total.

2) 10.13% of the Total Patients that have age 40 or less and have lymph node 5 or less have 100% survived from the breast cancer, i.e, almost 94% of their total.

3) Among the 81 deceased patients, 4 were between the ages of 30 and 40, which represents approximately 4.9% of the total deceased patient population.

4) Out of the 81 deceased patients, 45 were aged between 40 and 55, accounting for approximately 55.6% of the total deceased patient population.

**Year:**

1) In 1958 Most patient came for the the treatment of Breast Cancer.

2) During the initial years of treatment, specifically from 1958 to 1959, there was a higher mortality rate among women.

3) People who are treated in later year are more likely to survive may due to proper treatment.

4) In the Year 59, 60 and 67 recovery rate are above 84% that show really impressive but in year 62 and 65 recovery rate dropped significantly to 18.89% and 20.62% respectively.

5) In 1965, More Petients have nodes greater than 19, so that's why recovery rate is down and other factors may also influence it.

**Nodes:**

1) Patients which have less nodes are more likely to survive.

2) 77.12% Patients have 5 nodes or less.

3) 44.4% Patients have 0 node.

4) 80.5% Patients are successfully survived that have nodes 5 or less.

5) 19.5% Patients are not survived that have nodes 5 or less.

6)75.7% Patients are succuessfilly survived whose nodes are 15 or less.

7) 24.3% Patients are not survived having nodes 15 or less.

8) 7.1% Patients are those who have nodes are more than 15.

9) n that 54.5% Patients are died and 45.45% are survived

10) Most pateint survived having nodes greater than 15 and age more than 40 due to their operation in the year that have higher recovery rate like 1961, 1962, 1966 & 1967.
